SAMMI can listen to all SAMMI Voice triggers. 

To add a SAMMI Voice trigger, you will first have to set a trigger in the SAMMI Voice component. Please see our [set up page](https://sammi.solutions/docs/voice#addatriggertosammivoiceandasammicorebutton) for more information. 

Once you have identified the triggers you want in SAMMI Voice, you can set up the 'SAMMI Voice' trigger in your button. 

Ensure the spelling is identical in both SAMMI Voice and in your SAMMI button trigger.
